My Recipe website will help users to have all their recipes  in one place, easily accessible.
As user, I have always wanted to have a single point of access to all recipes my family has collected throuout the years, which are written on pieces of paper.

The primary goal of the website is to have easy access to recipes and preservance for the future.

# [](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/myRecipe-MS3#project-goals)Project goals

The purpose of this project to create website to enable users to be able to create, use, read, edit and delete their favourite recipes. The website has to be easy to navigate with clear purpose of the buttons and screen space.

# [](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/myRecipe-MS3#ux-requirements)UX requirements

The website targets the individuals interested to stop using paper and notes, old fashion way of recording recipes and digitise the records.

# Design Choices

When designing website I took inspiration for colours and fonts from the game Memory. The application is using colours and fonts scientifically proven to help users to learn and stimulate their cognitive functions.

# [](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/myRecipe-MS3#fonts)Fonts

I have used Google Fonts to determine the best fonts suitable for each part of the website, I.e. Logo, Menu and Body information.

I opted to use Open Sans font for my website, which is one of the most popular fonts used by major internet companies.

[Top 10 Best Google Fonts](https://nestify.io/blog/top-10-best-google-fonts/)

# [](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/myRecipe-MS3#icons)Icons

Icons used where provided by  [icons8](https://icons8.com/), used in moderation and are self explanatory.

# [](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/myRecipe-MS3#colours)Colours

The colours were determined by the pallet of Cooler website:

-   For navbar  [![navbar](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/LinguaGames-Project-MS2/raw/master/assets/colors/navbar.jpeg)](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/LinguaGames-Project-MS2/blob/master/assets/colors/navbar.jpeg)  I used linear gradient of rgb(5, 57, 97),

and rgb(10, 105, 177);

-   For body background: rgb(55, 149, 93).  [![Background](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/LinguaGames-Project-MS2/raw/master/assets/colors/green.jpeg)](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/LinguaGames-Project-MS2/blob/master/assets/colors/green.jpeg)

View my wireframes  [here](https://github.com/alexeykuz-sys/LinguaGames-Project-MS2/blob/master/WIREFRAMES.md). It's one-page website with a number of modal windows. I used JS to hide windows and information to make sure users are not distracted by excessive information on the page. I placed only fixed navigation bar with Logo and menu, linking user to the rules of the game and contact modal, and cards to play with.

Translation API that translates seamlessly behind the scene English words into three languages. More languages can be implemented at any time

Features to implement:

-   To add bigger choice of languages;
-   To increase number and difficulty of words;
-   To create competition board.
-   To create virtual badges, stars and list of words learn during the session to measure the learning process.
-   To add links to social media to enable users to share their achievements.

# Testing

All-testing has been documented  [testing.md](https://github.com/jamie120/ms3-eat-vegan-recipes/blob/master/testing.md)

Deployment

-   The site was developed in GitPod and pushed to the following remote GitHub repository -  []()
    -   The following GIT commands were used throughout deployment:
        -   **git status**  ------ used to check the status of files and any changes made / untracked.
        -   **git add**  ------ to stage files ready to commit.
        -   **git commit -m " "**  ------ to commit the files.
        -   **git push**  ------ to push the files to the master branch of the GitHub repo.

Hosting on Heroku

-   This site is hosted using Heroku, deployed directly from the master branch via GitHub. -  [LIVE SITE]
    
    -   The following steps were taken to complete the hosting process.
    
    1.  Set  **_debug=False_**  in the app.py file.
    2.  Created a requirements.txt file from the terminal, using  **_pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt_**, to allow Heroku to detect this project as a python app and any required package dependencies.
    3.  Created a Procfile using  **_echo web: python app.py > Procfile_**  from the Gitpod terminal so Heroku would be informed on which file runs the app and how to run this project.
    4.  Created a new Heroku app,  **_ms3_eat-vegan-recipes**  and set its region to Europe.
    5.  Automatic deployment was set up on Heroku - On the app dashboard, in the deploy menu. Connect to GitHub section. The GitHub repository was searched for and connected to the app.
    6.  In the settings tab on the app dashboard, 'Reveal Config Vars' was used to tell Heroku which variableS are required to run the app. The following config vars were added:
        -   **_IP_**
        -   **_PORT_**
        -   **_SECRET_KEY_**
        -   **_MONGO_URI_**
    7.  In GitPod, a check was completed to ensure the master branch was up to date and all commits had been pushed to GitHub, ready for Heroku to deploy.
    8.  Clicked the  **_Enable Automatic Deploys_**  button located in the  **_Deploy_**  section of Heroku to allow for automatic deploys.
    9.  Clicked the  **_Deploy Branch_**  button located in the  **_Deploy_**  section of Heroku to finally deploy this project.
    10.  Clicked the  **_View_**  button to launch this project's app.
    
    -   The deployed site on Heroku will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch in the GitHub Repo :  [REPO]
